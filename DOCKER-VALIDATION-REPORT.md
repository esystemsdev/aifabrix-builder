# Docker Infrastructure Validation Report

## Overview
Validated all Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yaml files in `aifabrix-setup/apps/` and fixed templates in `aifabrix-builder/templates/`.

## Architecture Fixed
- **Infrastructure**: Now only provides shared services (PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, optional management tools)
- **Applications**: Each app manages its own database initialization and dependencies
- **SDK Templates**: Enhanced to generate proper app deployment files based on schema requirements

## Validation Results

### ✅ Apps in aifabrix-setup/apps/

#### dataplane
- **Dockerfile**: Python 3.11-alpine with proper health checks, non-root user, spaCy model fallback
- **docker-compose**: Proper db-init pattern, volume mounting, external network
- **Status**: VALIDATED ✓

#### flowise  
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with Puppeteer/Chromium, proper mount directories
- **docker-compose**: Two databases (flowise + flowise-data), pgvector extensions installation
- **Status**: VALIDATED ✓

#### keycloak
- **Dockerfile**: Custom themes overlay on official Keycloak image
- **docker-compose**: Simple db-init pattern for keycloak database
- **Status**: VALIDATED ✓

#### miso-controller
- **Dockerfile**: Complex monorepo build with PNPM workspace, proper cleanup, mount directories
- **docker-compose**: Two databases (miso + miso-logs), proper dependency patterns
- **Status**: VALIDATED ✓

#### mori
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage NestJS build with API + UI, proper user management
- **docker-compose**: Standard db-init pattern for mori database
- **Status**: VALIDATED ✓

#### openwebui
- **Dockerfile**: Complex multi-stage with CUDA/Ollama options, model downloads, permission hardening
- **docker-compose**: Simple pattern with backend data volume mounting
- **Status**: VALIDATED ✓

## Template Improvements Made

### 1. templates/infra/compose.yaml ✅ FIXED
**Changes:**
- Removed Keycloak service (should be deployed as app)
- Removed Miso Controller service (should be deployed as app)  
- Removed db-init service (apps handle their own database initialization)
- Changed postgres image from `postgres:15-alpine` to `pgvector/pgvector:pg15`
- Added Redis persistence with `--appendonly yes`
- Added optional pgAdmin and Redis Commander services
- Fixed network name specification

**Now contains only infrastructure:**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Redis with persistence
- Optional pgAdmin (port 5050)
- Optional Redis Commander (port 8081)
- Proper network definition

### 2. templates/python/docker-compose.hbs ✅ ENHANCED
**Changes:**
- Added conditional volume mounting based on `requiresStorage` flag
- Added conditional db-init service based on `requiresDatabase` flag
- Added support for multiple databases from schema
- Uses pgvector/pgvector:pg15 image for db-init
- Proper database and user creation with permissions
- External network reference

### 3. templates/typescript/docker-compose.hbs ✅ ENHANCED
**Changes:**
- Added conditional volume mounting based on `requiresStorage` flag
- Added conditional db-init service based on `requiresDatabase` flag
- Added support for multiple databases from schema
- Uses pgvector/pgvector:pg15 image for db-init
- Proper database and user creation with permissions
- External network reference

### 4. templates/python/Dockerfile.hbs ✅ REVIEWED
**Status**: Already includes good patterns
- Non-root user creation
- dumb-init for signal handling
- Health checks with curl
- Proper layer caching

### 5. templates/typescript/Dockerfile.hbs ✅ REVIEWED  
**Status**: Already includes good patterns
- Non-root user creation
- dumb-init for signal handling
- Health checks with curl
- Proper layer caching

## Key Patterns Implemented

1. **Database Initialization**: Each app creates its own databases and users via db-init container
2. **Volume Mounting**: Apps with `requiresStorage=true` mount local volumes to `/mnt/data`
3. **Network**: All services connect to external network `aifabrix-network`
4. **Health Checks**: Consistent patterns with curl/wget tests
5. **pgvector**: Infrastructure and db-init use pgvector/pgvector:pg15 image
6. **Conditional Services**: Templates use Handlebars conditionals based on schema flags

## Schema Integration

Templates now properly integrate with `application-schema.json`:
- `requiresDatabase` → generates db-init service
- `requiresStorage` → adds volume mounting
- `databases` array → creates multiple databases
- `port` → application port configuration
- `build.localPort` → local development port mapping

## Summary

All existing app Dockerfiles are validated and follow excellent practices. The infrastructure template has been corrected to only provide shared services, and the app templates have been enhanced to properly handle database initialization and storage requirements based on the application schema.

The SDK can now generate proper deployment files that align with the working patterns found in the existing apps.
