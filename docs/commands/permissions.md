# Online Commands and Permissions

← [Documentation index](../README.md) · [Commands index](README.md)

Reference for CLI commands that call **online** APIs (Miso Controller or Dataplane). Each command requires login and the listed permission(s) on the target service. Permissions are enforced by the Controller or Dataplane RBAC; assign roles that grant the required scopes.

---

## Services

- **Controller** – Miso Controller (applications, environments, deployments, pipeline validate/deploy, auth).
- **Dataplane** – AI Fabrix Dataplane (external systems, credentials, wizard, pipeline publish/test, datasources).

## Environment-scoped access

Dataplane is **installed per environment** (e.g. dev, tst, pro). You must set permissions for the **target** dataplane and environment you use. Pipeline access and RBAC work the same way: they are **per environment**. Any endpoint that takes an `envKey` (e.g. pipeline validate/deploy, environment applications) is scoped to that environment. Configure the correct roles and permissions for the environment you target (dev, tst, or pro). **All permissions listed below can be set from the Miso Controller web interface** (roles, groups, and scopes per environment).

## Command → Service → Permissions

| Command | Service | Required permission(s) | Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `aifabrix login` | Controller | None (device or client credentials) | Obtains token; subsequent commands use token scopes. |
| `aifabrix logout` | Controller | None | Clears local tokens. |
| `aifabrix show <app> --online` | Controller | `applications:read` or env-scoped app access | Fetches template app and/or environment application. For **external** (dataplane) apps, also calls Dataplane for system details → **Dataplane** `external-system:read` required in that case. |
| `aifabrix app show <app>` | Controller + Dataplane (if external) | Controller: `applications:read` or env-scoped app. If external: **Dataplane** `external-system:read` | Same as `show --online`. For external type, also calls Dataplane for system details (get external system, config, OpenAPI files/endpoints). |
| `aifabrix app register <appKey>` | Controller | `environments-applications:create` | Register app in environment and get client credentials. |
| `aifabrix app list` | Controller | `environments-applications:read` | List applications in the configured environment. |
| `aifabrix app rotate-secret <appKey>` | Controller | `environments-applications:update` | Rotate client secret for the app. |
| `aifabrix env deploy <env>` | Controller | `controller:deploy` | Deploy environment infrastructure. |
| `aifabrix deploy [app]` | Controller | `applications:deploy` | Validate then deploy; uses pipeline validate + deploy. |
| `aifabrix deployments` | Controller | `deployments:read` | List deployments for the environment. |
| `aifabrix credential list` | Dataplane | `credential:read` | Lists credentials on the **Dataplane** for the configured environment. The Controller does not offer this operation; ensure the CLI targets the correct Dataplane base URL. |
| `aifabrix download [systemKey]` | Dataplane | `external-system:read` | Download external system config from Dataplane. |
| `aifabrix upload [system-key]` | Dataplane | `external-system:publish`; **credential:create** (if using automatic push of KV_* from `.env`) | **Pipeline upload** on the Dataplane: draft upload, validation, and publish in one flow. The CLI shows a **Dataplane pipeline warning** before sending configuration. It may push credential material from `integration/<systemKey>/.env` (KV_* variables) and from `kv://` references using the credential APIs — **credential:create** is required for that push. If the push is denied, upload may still proceed without secrets. **Bearer token** from `aifabrix login` (or equivalent) is required; client id/secret are not accepted for this command. |
| `aifabrix datasource upload` | Dataplane | `external-system:publish` | **Datasource-scoped publish** on the Dataplane. The CLI displays a **Dataplane pipeline warning** before sending configuration. |
| `aifabrix datasource test` | Dataplane | `external-system:publish` or `external-data-source:read` | Unified validation run (test run type) on the dataplane; same deployment auth as `test-integration`. |
| `aifabrix datasource test-integration` | Dataplane | `external-system:publish` or `external-data-source:read` | Unified validation run (integration) on the dataplane; supports deployment auth including **client credentials** exchanged for an app token (CI/CD). |
| `aifabrix datasource test-e2e` | Dataplane | `external-data-source:read` | Unified validation run (E2E) on the dataplane; uses the **same deployment auth** as `test-integration` (e.g. `aifabrix login` or app credentials). |
| `aifabrix datasource log-test` | Local | — | Reads a previously saved JSON log from `integration/<systemKey>/logs/`; **no** Controller or Dataplane request. |
| `aifabrix test-integration` | Dataplane | `external-system:publish` or `external-data-source:read` | Calls pipeline test endpoint; supports **client credentials** (CI/CD). |
| `aifabrix validate <app> --cert-sync` | Dataplane | Same scopes as **`validate`** for the target, plus **`external-system:read`** when the CLI fetches the active certificate | Optional post-success step: refreshes **only** the `certification` object in the local `*-system` file. See [Certification and trust (CLI)](certification-and-trust.md). |
| `aifabrix show` / `aifabrix app show` with **`--verify-cert`** | Dataplane | **`external-system:read`** (when verify runs) | Optional certificate verify lines for external apps; does not require publish scope. |
| `aifabrix wizard [systemKey]` | Dataplane | `external-system:create`, `external-system:read`, `credential:read` (for credential step) | Wizard sessions and steps use Dataplane wizard API. |
| `aifabrix integration-client create` | Controller | `integration-client:create` | Create integration client (key, displayName, redirectUris, optional groupNames); receive one-time clientSecret (save at creation time). |
| `aifabrix integration-client list` | Controller | `integration-client:read` | List integration clients with optional pagination and search. |
| `aifabrix integration-client rotate-secret` | Controller | `integration-client:update` | Regenerate client secret for an integration client; new secret shown once only. |
| `aifabrix integration-client delete` | Controller | `integration-client:delete` | Deactivate an integration client. |
| `aifabrix integration-client update-groups` | Controller | `integration-client:update` | Update group assignments for an integration client. |
| `aifabrix integration-client update-redirect-uris` | Controller | `integration-client:update` | Update redirect URIs for an integration client (min 1). |
| `aifabrix dimension create` | Controller | `dimensions:create` (and `dimensions:read` for idempotent behavior) | Creates the dimension if missing; succeeds if it already exists. Supports `--file` for CI/CD. |
| `aifabrix dimension get` | Controller | `dimensions:read` | Reads one dimension by id or key. |
| `aifabrix dimension list` | Controller | `dimensions:read` | Lists dimensions with optional paging/search. |
| `aifabrix dimension-value create` | Controller | `dimensions:create` | Creates a value for a dimension (static dimension). Value must be unique within the dimension. |
| `aifabrix dimension-value list` | Controller | `dimensions:read` | Lists values for a dimension. |
| `aifabrix dimension-value delete` | Controller | `dimensions:delete` | Deletes a dimension value by id. |

For `aifabrix datasource test`, `datasource test-integration`, and `datasource test-e2e`, flags such as `--watch` only re-run the same command when local files change; permissions and Dataplane scopes are unchanged per invocation.

## Dataplane permissions (summary)

- **external-system:read** – List/get external systems, config, OpenAPI files/endpoints, wizard deployment docs, platforms. Also covers read-only **pipeline upload** listing and retrieval and **deployment validation** on the Dataplane.
- **external-system:create** – Create external system, from-template, wizard sessions and steps (parse, detect-type, generate-config, validate, etc.).
- **external-system:update** – Update external system, publish, rollback, save-template, deployment docs POST.
- **external-system:delete** – Delete (soft) external system.
- **external-system:publish** – Dataplane **pipeline deployment** (mutating): full-system upload (draft or published), optional validate, and datasource-scoped publish require **OAuth2 (Bearer) only**; client id/secret are **not** accepted for those flows. **Pipeline test** (system or per-datasource) accepts Bearer, API key, or **client credentials** (x-client-id / x-client-secret) for CI/CD.
- **external-data-source:read** – Dataplane pipeline test and datasource validation runs. Can be used for pipeline test (alternative to `external-system:publish`). Covers `aifabrix datasource test` and `test-integration` when not using `external-system:publish`, and is required for `aifabrix datasource test-e2e` (unified E2E validation run; same login or app-token style auth as `test-integration`).
- **credential:read** – List/get credentials, wizard credentials list.
- **credential:create** – Create credential (if used by wizard).
- **credential:update** – Update credential.
- **credential:delete** – Delete credential.
- **audit:read** – Execution logs, RBAC/ABAC queries (datasource executions when applicable).
- **Pipeline auth split** – **Publish to controller** from the Dataplane accepts **client credentials only** (x-client-id, x-client-secret); Bearer is not used there. **Upload**, **datasource upload**, and **validate** on the Dataplane accept **OAuth2 (Bearer) or API key only**; client id/secret are rejected for those commands. Use `aifabrix login` (or a token with the right scope) for upload and datasource upload; use client credentials only for the controller-publish path (typical CI flow).
