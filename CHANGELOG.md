## [2.1.4] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed
- Fixed PostgreSQL database initialization to support database names with hyphens (e.g., `miso-logs`)
  - Added `pgQuote` Handlebars helper to properly quote PostgreSQL identifiers in SQL commands
  - Added `pgUser` Handlebars helper to generate properly quoted PostgreSQL user names
  - Database and user names with hyphens are now correctly quoted in CREATE DATABASE and CREATE USER commands
- Fixed password handling security issue in Docker Compose generation
  - Changed from parsing passwords from DATABASE_URL or generating random passwords to requiring explicit `DB_PASSWORD` or `DB_0_PASSWORD` variables in `.env` files
  - Passwords must now be explicitly set in `.env` files (typically resolved from `kv://` references)
  - Improved password validation to distinguish between missing password variables and empty password values
  - Provides clear error messages when required password variables are missing or empty

### Changed
- Database password resolution now requires `DB_PASSWORD` (single database) or `DB_0_PASSWORD`, `DB_1_PASSWORD`, etc. (multiple databases) to be set in `.env` files
- Password validation now uses key existence checks (`in` operator) instead of truthiness checks to properly handle empty values
- Docker Compose templates now use environment variables (`DB_0_PASSWORD`, `DB_1_PASSWORD`) for database passwords instead of hardcoded values

### Security
- Eliminated hardcoded database passwords from Docker Compose templates
- Database passwords must now be explicitly provided via `.env` files (resolved from secure key vaults)
- Improved password validation prevents accidental use of empty passwords

## [2.1.3] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed
- Fixed `aifabrix status` command showing ❌ for running services (normalized status value to handle quotes and whitespace)
- Fixed `aifabrix push` command to use correct image name from `variables.yaml` instead of app name
  - Now correctly resolves image name from `image.name`, `app.key`, or falls back to app name
  - Matches the same logic used by `aifabrix build` command
- Improved authentication error handling in push command:
  - Detects authentication errors and provides clear login instructions
  - Automatically retries authentication if push fails with auth error
  - Shows helpful error messages with `az acr login` command

### Changed
- Enhanced push error messages to include authentication troubleshooting steps
- Status command now normalizes Docker container status values before comparison

## [2.1.2] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed
- Authentication validation now allows `enableSSO: false` without requiring `type` and `requiredRoles` fields
- Fixed validation error when using authentication section with only `enableSSO: false` (e.g., in keycloak template)
- Authentication fields are now conditionally required based on `enableSSO` value:
  - When `enableSSO: false`: only `enableSSO` field is required
  - When `enableSSO: true`: `type`, `enableSSO`, and `requiredRoles` are required

### Changed
- Updated authentication schema to use conditional validation with `allOf` rules
- Updated `buildAuthenticationConfig()` to default `type: 'none'` and `requiredRoles: []` when `enableSSO: false`
- Updated variable transformer to handle partial authentication objects correctly

## [2.1.1] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- `--debug` flag for `aifabrix run` command to output detailed container information
- Debug logging for port detection, container status, Docker commands, and health check details
- Health check response format documentation in application schema
- Health check response format validation documentation in CONFIGURATION.md

### Changed
- Enhanced health check validation to support multiple response formats:
  - `status: "UP"` (Keycloak format)
  - `status: "ok"` (standard format with optional database connection check)
  - `status: "healthy"` (alternative format)
  - `success: true` (success-based format)
  - Non-JSON responses with HTTP 200 status code

### Documentation
- Added health check response format documentation to application schema JSON
- Added health check response format examples to CONFIGURATION.md
- Added `--debug` flag documentation to CLI-REFERENCE.md

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- Automatic README.md generation for applications during `aifabrix create`
- Application-specific README template with build instructions, prerequisites, and troubleshooting
- Conditional README sections based on application configuration (database, redis, storage, authentication)
- README.md generation only if file doesn't already exist (non-destructive)

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-27

### Changed
- Updated documentation to reflect pipeline API authentication model (ClientId/ClientSecret + JWT)
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow examples to use correct pipeline API endpoints
- Clarified deployment authentication: pipeline uses ClientId/Secret, regular APIs use Keycloak tokens
- Fixed MisoClient configuration example typo in CONFIGURATION.md (process.APPLICATION_KEY → process.env.APPLICATION_KEY)

### Added
- Azure Marketplace deployment documentation
- External registry support in push command with --registry-type flag
- Deployment configuration section in application-schema.json
- Application registration documentation (aifabrix app register)
- Deployment logs documentation
- Pipeline environment variables documentation
- Support for Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, and other external registries
- authenticateExternalRegistry function for external registry authentication

### Fixed
- Incorrect pipeline API examples showing bearer tokens (now uses ClientId/Secret)
- Incorrect response field names (acrToken → validateToken, deploymentServer → acrServer)
- Missing tenantId parameter documentation (handled internally by controller)
- Incorrect environment variables for pipeline deployment (removed CONTROLLER_API_KEY, TENANT_ID, CLIENT_ID as env ID)
